# Wordle
Hello, this is my Wordle clone. It has all the core logic and features of Wordle. 
### Features:
* Has a word of the day which changes daily
* Letter color feedback. On both the keyboard and word rows
* Physical and on screen keyboard support

### Potential Future Features:
* Persistence across browser sessions. Most likely using localStorage
* Maybe some authentication/user accounts. However this would require a lot of time and integration with databases.
